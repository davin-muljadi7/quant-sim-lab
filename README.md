A minimal, end-to-end quantitative simulation and backtesting project in Python.

## What this project does
- Simulates financial price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
- Implements simple trading strategies (starting with buy-and-hold)
- Backtests strategies on simulated data
- Computes PnL and returns
- Designed for learning quantitative finance fundamentals (not a trading bot)
